We are proud to announce the latest version of Unikraft, `v0.20.0`!
This release comes with the much anticipated redesign and implementation of VFS, which brings enhanced performance, better maintainability, and improved compatibility with modern applications.
For more info refer to [the accompanying blog post](https://unikraft.org/blog/2025-09-08-unikraft-releases-v0.20.0).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **DEPRECATION NOTICE:** The old VFS, vfscore, will be deprecated in Unikraft 0.22.0 (early 2026).
> For help on transitioning, consult the migration guide or join us on Discord.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **COMPATIBILITY NOTICE:** The implementation of `arch_prctl` system call has been migrated from `app-elfloader` to `libposix-process`.
> Configurations using `CONFIG_APPELFLOADER_ARCH_PRCTL` should now use `CONFIG_LIBPOSIX_PROCESS_ARCH_PRCTL`.

A summary of the most important changes follows.
For the full list of changes see the [changelog](https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft/compare/RELEASE-0.19.1...RELEASE-0.20.0).

### 🚀 New Features

### Filesystem & Storage

- `libukfs`: New library for the filesystem interface, driver templates and utilities
- `libukfs-ramfs`: `ukfs` memory-resident volatile filesystem
- `libukfs-devfs`: `ukfs` pseudo-filesystem that provides files under /dev
- `libukfs-pseudo`: New library home to pseudo-files previously provided by `posix-tty`; also provides pseudo-files under devfs
- `posix-vfs`: New library for POSIX-compliant virtual filesystem layer on top of `ukfs`
- `posix-vfs-fstab`: New library for mounting filesystems at boot according to predefined tables (fstabs)
- `libukpod`: Utility library for managing pages-on-demand - used by filesystem drivers
- `libuksparsebuf`: Utility library for efficient management of sparse buffers - used by filesystem drivers
- `libukfile`: Add interface to expose & manage file backing memory

#### Context Management

- `lcpu`: Enhanced exception handling with context escape trampolines

#### System Call and Process

- `libposix-fdio`: Support the `sendfile()` syscall
- `libposix-process`: Signal the application on system error (`SIGSEGV`, `SIGILL` etc.)

#### Networking

- `virtio-net`, `liblwip`: Support Mergeable RX buffers (`VIRTIO_NET_F_MRG_RXBUF`)
- `virtio-net`, `liblwip`: Support Large Receive Offload (LRO)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes & Improvements

#### Memory Management

- `libukallocbuddy`: Refactor to support asymmetric `palloc()` / `pfree()` operations
- `ukallocpool`: Various improvements to enhance performance
- `libukvmem`: Fix VMA stack population logic
- `libukalloc`: Ensure sufficient memory allocation for region metadata
- `libukallocregion`: Various enhancements and improvements

#### Context Management

- `libuksched`: Remove unnecessary ECTX saving/restoration for cooperative thread switching

#### System Call and Process

- `libposix-process`: Refactor the kernel event API
- `libposix-process`: Fix exit code propagation to termination context

#### Architecture and Platform

- `lcpu`: Align exception handling stacks across architectures

#### Synchronization & Atomics

- `libuklock`: Optimize `ukmutex` and allow opt-out of atomics in the fast patch.
- `libuklock`: Introduce semaphore operation to consume all tokens at once

#### Network Stack

- `virtio-net`: Use single descriptor for packets
- `virtio-net`: Keep event suppression mechanism internal
- `virtio-net`: Split feature probing and negotiation

#### Development & Debugging

- `libsyscall-shim`: Enhance syscall tracing with pretty-print decoding for socket, filesystem, and process syscalls
